# crio changelog

## 5.0.1

* Replacement of webpack with rollup for `dist` builds

## 5.0.0

* Replace use of `lodash/fp` with `unchanged` for both smaller size and faster speed
* Subclass native `Array` instead of create array-like object class (leverages speed of `Array`)

#### BREAKING CHANGES

* Remove support for IE10- (does not support subclass of native `Array` class)
* Remove all `*In` methods (`deleteIn`, `getIn`, `hasIn`, `mergeIn`, `pluckIn`, `setIn`), instead let their previously-singular counterparts handle both use cases
* Add `findLast` method for both `CrioArray` and `CrioObject`
* Add `keyOf` and `lastKeyOf` for `CrioObject` (similar to `indexOf` and `lastIndexOf` for `Array`, but for `Object`)
* `includes` now checks for strict equality instead of deep equality (aligning with spec for `Array`)
* `find`, `findIndex`, and `findKey` no longer accept `fromIndex` / `fromKey` (aligning with spec for `Array`)
* Iterable methods (`entries`, `keys`, `values`) now return `CrioArray` instead of plain JS `Array`

## 4.1.2

* Include `push` method for `CrioArray` (somehow was missing in v4 rewrite)

## 4.1.1

* Prevent deep cloning when possible (performance)

## 4.1.0

* Add `es` transpilation in addition to standard `lib`, preserving ES2015 modules for [`pkg.module`](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/pkg.module)
* Fix issue related to spread operator used for shallow clones in node environment

## 4.0.0

* Complete rewrite, leveraging lodash wherever possible
* Massive speed improvement (over 70% in certain cases)
* Added `findKey` and `findLastKey` for `CrioObject`s
* Breaking changes
  * `length` is now exclusive to `CrioArray`, `size` is the property on `CrioObject` (prevents lodash from incorrectly identifying it as an array)
  * `merge` and `mergeIn` are now recursive instead of shallow
  * `hashCode` is now computed at runtime based on current object
  * No reconciliation between pre- and post-transformation takes place now (always creates a new `Crio`)

* Failed publish

## 3.4.1

* Add `lodash-webpack-plugin` for smaller `dist` builds

## 3.4.0

* Simplify shallow cloning with value assignment in `set` method (5-13% performance improvement)

## 3.3.1

* Prevent `delete` and `deleteIn` from making clones when key being deleted does not exist
* Optimize `isReactElement` check
* Documentation to include `entries`, `keys`, and `values` for `CrioObject`

## 3.3.0

* Added `difference`, `intersection`, and `xor` to the available methods for `CrioArray`

## 3.2.0

* Added `hasIn` and `pluckIn` to the available methods for both `CrioArray` and `CrioObject`

## 3.1.0

* Return `pluck` to prototypes
* Add `pluck` as available for `CrioObject`
* Add `isCrio`, `isArray`, and `isObject` method to main `crio` method

## 3.0.0

* Complete rewrite for better performance, scalability, testability, and code management
* `compact`, `has`, `hasOwnProperty`, and `includes` now are available on both `CrioArray` and `CrioObject`
* More accurate implementation of `entries`, `keys`, `values`, and iterators
* Performance improvement of ~25% in high-volume scenarios
* Far superior test coverage

## 2.8.2

* Fix issue where `hash-it` was not being included as a dependency
* Modify `forEach` and `forEachRight` to be recursive functions instead of `while` loops

## 2.8.1

* Fix a couple issues centered around `.entries()` for both `CrioArray` and `CrioObject`

## 2.8.0

* Switch to using `Symbol` instead of string key creation for internal `hashCode` and `type` properties to prevent potential naming conflicts

## 2.7.1

* Update `hash-it` dependency

## 2.7.0

* Replace native hashing with [hash-it](https://github.com/planttheidea/hash-it)

## 2.6.1

* Updates to reduce the filesize of dist files
* Use standard source map for dev dist file

## 2.6.0

* Add `first` and `last` functions to `CrioArray`
* Hashing optimizations by only using replacer function if ReactElement is included
* Fix a couple typos in README

## 2.5.5

* Improve performance of `deleteIn`

## 2.5.4

* Remove try / catch from hash function (performance improvement of ~11% across the board)
* Change native key checker to use map instead of array to avoid usage of indexOf

## 2.5.3

* Micro-optimizations for cloning / merging arrays and objects

## 2.5.2

* Improve performance of mapping ReactElements by not attempting to stringify it (recursive object, just assume its always new)

## 2.5.1

* Fix ReactElements not being treated as immutable and attempting to be crioed

## 2.5.0

* Add `forEach` to `CrioObject` API

## 2.4.0

* Add `clear` to both `CrioArray` and `CrioObject` APIs
* Add `compact`, `pluck`, `toObject`, and `unique` to `CrioArray` API
* Add `filter`, `map`, and `toArray` to `CrioObject` API

## 2.3.2

* Remove unneeded shallow clones for each instance of `mergeIn`

## 2.3.1

* Performance improvements centered around `setIn`
* Fix `delete` / `deleteIn` bug when `NODE_ENV=production`

## 2.3.0

* Add `delete` and `deleteIn` functions for both `CrioArray` and `CrioObject`
* Add `has` function for both `CrioArray` and `CrioObject` (checks if key passed exists in the object)

## 2.2.2

* Apply polyfills for `copyWithin` and `fill` (before they only leveraged the existing prototype method, which failed on IE)
* Apparently `reverse` for `CrioArray`s got lost? Adding it back in

## 2.2.1

* Prevent double-hashing when existing objects have changed
* Improve deep setting / merging function
* Fix several confusions with this vs thisArg in applied methods
* Improve speed of bitwise hashing mechanism

## 2.2.0

* Turn of Object.freeze when NODE_ENV=production (performance)

## 2.1.3

* Use try / catch with JSON.stringify for fastest and most consistent object-to-string conversion, will fallback to use stringifier when recursive
* Write more tests for new functions

## 2.1.2

* Performance improvements
* Make hash SHA1-based

## 2.0.2

* Fix behavior difference between .concat() and .push()

## 2.0.1

* Switch `CrioArray.prototype.includes` to use bitwise operation instead of index !== -1 (performance)

## 2.0.0

* Complete rewrite for performance and sustainability
* Full code coverage with AVA

## 1.0.1

* Improve bug in .equals() to be recursive
* Change object to recursively apply crio rather than only for Arrays and Objects (for future state)

## 1.0.0

* Initial release!
